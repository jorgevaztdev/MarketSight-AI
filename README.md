# 📊 MarketSightAI  
*Real-time Competitive Intelligence for AI Product Teams*

MarketSightAI is a full-stack dashboard that scrapes, analyzes, and visualizes competitor activity—everything from pricing changes to new feature releases to shifting sentiment in user reviews. It’s built for product teams who want to move fast, stay strategic, and keep a finger on the pulse of the AI landscape.

## 🧠 Why MarketSightAI?

As a product leader at fast-growing startups, I constantly craved *live, actionable insight* about what competitors were building, launching, and how their users felt about it. MarketPulse is my response: part product intuition, part technical execution, and 100% focused on shipping scrappy insight fast.
